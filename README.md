Safe520 app

Overview

With our app you can search by zip code and see a history of places and types of crime that have occured over the past five years. With this app you can determine if itâ€™s safe to go for a walk or let your kids go for a bike ride. Our goal is to help families and individuals know what to expect in their neck of Tucson or what would be good place to call home.
